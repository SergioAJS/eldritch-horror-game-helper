# Eldritch Horror Helper

## Project Description

Many board game lovers have heard of Ancient Terror as one of the most interesting board game adventures, but there is one difficulty: it takes 40 minutes to an hour to prepare for the game for inexperienced players and one of the most difficult conditions is to compile a deck of myths.  
As part of this project, a small helper application has been created to build a deck of myths for the board game "Eldritch Horror".
